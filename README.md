Transmission Absorption Photoluminescence Spectroscopy data collector (MPhys project 2012).

Allows for spectra to be recorded from an Ocean Optics 2000/4000 and tagged with the sample's temperature as recorded through the National Instruments DAQmx driver.  Calibration of the DAQmx hardware is possible using the included calibration tool.

Spectra can be algebraically manipulated in the GUI (for example, to remove the background spectrum and convert transmission spectra to absorption spectra) and saved for further analysis (e.g. in Origin Lab).
